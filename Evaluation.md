# Opinions fron the development team:
# Aki
What went well:

- Design ideas were thrown around the team, allowing for more input

What may have been difficult:

- Finding work for everyone as me and Tay [Tori] have partially struggled with finding jobs to do due to lack of html knowlege
  
- Keeping track of updates as none of us would know if an update is present due to a lack of an announcement feature in github
  
- Keeping up with changes of rooms as not all of our data was shared through computers which could have been annoying for logging into github or any other services needed

If we had more time:

- Could have tried to sort out the repository out more

-  Could have formatted this repository as more 

What could be improved if we were to do this again:

- having a more thought-out plan with creating jobs with the gantt chart where ALL members are being allocated jobs, allowing us to be more certain with who is doing what.
