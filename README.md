# Formatting Apology from Aki

I am deeply sorry for all of the layout changes that have become possibly more and more annoying to deal with...
i have intentionally set the formatting into a lot of files to make it easier to access any data we may need, hopefully creating an easier way of implementing which asset we need

It was also made to make the assets feel less cluttered to allow easier finding of any assets we needed to change or improve.

Thanks for reading!
