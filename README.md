# IMPORTANT

Please fill in 'main/Evaluation.md' with the requested info [What went well, what may have been difficult, changes if we had more time, and any improvements if yu were to do it next time] and place a few opinions about the project!

This MUST be completed before we hand this in on Tuesday the 10th!!

# Before you upload!!
Make sure to add files to the respective folder in the repository to a point that it makes sense, like the gantt chart would go into 'main/Formal Files/Gantt'

Make sure any references to directionaries are labeled with '' to avoid confusion

Make sure all dictionary referances start with 'main/' or the branch name to begin with

# Updates
If you are uploading a new version of it {like an image update} PLEASE delete or backup the old version incase you make a mistake!

We do not want old code that still worked or even old images that were better to be lost completly

'main/Backup' had been made if you realy do not want to save the files locally on yur school account or the local user on the PC

# Once uploaded
Make sure you record any changes yu made in 'main/UPDATELOG.md' except from changes to the update log itself

Make sure to Backup Older files in either a seperate folder in the same directionary, or to place the updated file into 'main/Backup' corresponding tio the file it would normally be in. For example If i updated 'Icon[TRANSPARRENT].png', i would place it into 'main/Backup/Source/Icons/Icon 2/'.
